# LiveDocs

## Wahat is LiveDocs?
This tool is the result of my master thesis "LiveDocs: Document-Centric Process Management".

LiveDocs allows the development of form-driven web applications using CINCO. It consist of two components, a modeling tool and a web
application. With the modeling tool, a LiveDocs-modeler can create different document types. The modeler defines the content of document, such as panels and input fields. Furthermore, the structure of a document can be modeled by using the defined panels. The document’s structure does not follow a rigid process, and thus “living” documents can be created. Therefore, only dependencies between the form parts are controlled automatically. The corresponding web application includes the defined document types so that a LiveDocs-user can create a document of a specific type and can fill in the included form. In the web
application, a user can complete a document by filling out and submitting a form. The document is validated automatically to guarantee semantic correctness. In addition to semantic correctness, the document is model checked by satisfying global constraints.
